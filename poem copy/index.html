    <h2>I wandered lonely as a cloud</h2>
    <h3 class="author">by William Wordsworth</h3>
     <p>
       I wandered lonely as a cloud<br/>
       That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br/>
       When all at once I saw a crowd,<br/>
       A host, of golden daffodils;<br/>
       Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br/>
       Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       Continuous as the stars that shine<br/>
       And twinkle on the milky way,<br/>
       They stretched in never-ending line<br/>
       Along the margin of a bay:<br/>
       Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br/>
       Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       The waves beside them danced; but they<br/>
       Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br/>
       A poet could not but be gay,<br/>
       In such a jocund company:<br/>
       I gazed—gazed—but little thought<br/>
       What wealth the show to me had brought:<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       For oft, when on my couch I lie<br/>
       In vacant or in pensive mood,<br/>
       They flash upon that inward eye<br/>
       Which is the bliss of solitude;<br/>
       And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br/>
       And dances with the daffodils.<br/>

   <h2>Hope is the thing with feathers</h2>
   <h3 class="author">by Emily Dickinson</h3>
    <p>
      Hope is the thing with feathers<br/>
      That perches in the soul,<br/>
      And sings the tune without the words,<br/>
      And never stops at all,<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      And sweetest in the gale is heard;<br/>
      And sore must be the storm<br/>
      That could abash the little bird<br/>
      That kept so many warm.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      I 've heard it in the chillest land,<br/>
      And on the strangest sea;<br/>
      Yet, never, in extremity,<br/>
      It asked a crumb of me.

    <h2>A Dream Within a Dream</h2>
    <h3 class="author">by Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
     <p>
       Take this kiss upon the brow!<br/>
       And, in parting from you now,<br/>
       Thus much let me avow —<br/>
       You are not wrong, who deem<br/>
       That my days have been a dream;<br/>
       Yet if hope has flown away<br/>
       In a night, or in a day,<br/>
       In a vision, or in none,<br/>
       Is it therefore the less gone?<br/>
       All that we see or seem<br/>
       Is but a dream within a dream.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       I stand amid the roar<br/>
       Of a surf-tormented shore,<br/>
       And I hold within my hand<br/>
       Grains of the golden sand —<br/>
       How few! yet how they creep<br/>
       Through my fingers to the deep,<br/>
       While I weep — while I weep!<br/>
       O God! Can I not grasp<br/>
       Them with a tighter clasp?<br/>
       O God! can I not save<br/>
       One from the pitiless wave?<br/>
       Is all that we see or seem<br/>
       But a dream within a dream?<br/>
