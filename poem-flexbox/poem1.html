    <h2>I wandered lonely as a cloud</h2>
    <h3 class="author">by William Wordsworth</h3>
     <p>
       I wandered lonely as a cloud<br/>
       That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br/>
       When all at once I saw a crowd,<br/>
       A host, of golden daffodils;<br/>
       Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br/>
       Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       Continuous as the stars that shine<br/>
       And twinkle on the milky way,<br/>
       They stretched in never-ending line<br/>
       Along the margin of a bay:<br/>
       Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br/>
       Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       The waves beside them danced; but they<br/>
       Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br/>
       A poet could not but be gay,<br/>
       In such a jocund company:<br/>
       I gazed—gazed—but little thought<br/>
       What wealth the show to me had brought:<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       For oft, when on my couch I lie<br/>
       In vacant or in pensive mood,<br/>
       They flash upon that inward eye<br/>
       Which is the bliss of solitude;<br/>
       And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br/>
       And dances with the daffodils.<br/>
    </p>
